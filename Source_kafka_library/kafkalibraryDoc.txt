Apache Kafka-
	 Distributed publish-subscribe msg system/msg broker which is DURABLE as data is persistent. 

Common Terms in Kafka

1. Record: Producer sends messages to Kafka in the form of records. A record is a key-value pair. 
2.Topic: Producer writes a record on a topic and the consumer listens to it.Each Topic has partitions.
3. Offset: A record in a partition has an offset associated with it. Offsets are committed to the broker asynchronously 
   and synchronously.
4. Producer: Creates a record and publishes it to the broker.
5.Consumer: Consumes records from the broker

KAFKA PRODUCER AND CONSUMER
		To create a Kafka Producer and Consumerin general following properties have to be set-

		*BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG: The Kafka broker's address.
		*CLIENT_ID_CONFIG: Id of the producer so that the broker can determine the source of the request.
		*KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG: The class that will be used to serialize the key object. 
			IF key is string, we use the StringSerializer class to serialize the key. 
		*VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG: The class that will be used to serialize the value object.

		*MAX_POLL_RECORDS_CONFIG: The max count of records that the consumer will fetch in one iteration.
		*ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT_CONFIG: When the consumer from a group receives a message it commit the offset of that record.
 
LIBRARY Summary
		IMessageBroker Interface- Declares the methods required for Connect, Publishing and subscribing, Close from 
		broker

Publishing (using library) 

    The Producer calls 
	1.Connect() using broker url-localhost:9092
	2.Publish () using topic name and value and key
	3.Close()

Similarly for Subscriber 
        1.Connect()
	2.Subscribe()
	3.Close()

Methods....
*All the producer and consumer props are included in library.IsConnect() function checks whether the server is connected or not
* The producer calls the demo callback function which ensures server has acknowldged the data sent.
* The consumer uses  poll() method which waits until timeout for records to arrive at the server.
  Then the consumer commits the offset before closing the connection.Similary the consumer can subscribe from multiple topics.
* KafkaFileProducer() and FileConsumer() also reads the contents of a file and publish to topic
 and subscribe from a topic.
